### Greetings!
My name is Ehsan Yousefzadeh and I hold a master's degree in Computer Architecture from the Sharif University of Technology. My primary field of interest is Computer Architecture, particularly GPUs, parallel computing systems, and energy-efficient designs and their application in heterogeneous systems. Additionally, I am enthusiastically willing to work and research on hardware accelerators, especially for Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Networks (NN) applications (Generally Data Intensive Applications).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Resource-Aware Data Science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Deep Learning (DL) and Computer Architecure. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on simulators for processors. The goal is learning through doing.
