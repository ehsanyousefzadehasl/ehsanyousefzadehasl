### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I graduated with a master's degree in Computer Engineering - Computer Architecture from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. My primary field of interest is Computer Architecture,
particularly GPUs, parallel computing systems, and energy-efficient designs and their application in heterogeneous systems. Additionally, I am perfectly willing to work and research on hardware accelerators, especially for ML and NN applications.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computer architecture
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about computer architecture, machine learning, deep learning, and other computer science concepts to fill my knowledge gaps, and also mathematics, especially statistics and probability.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simulators for processors
