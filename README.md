### Greetings!
I am Ehsan, a Ph.D. student at the IT University of Copenhagen. I got my master's in computer architecture from the SUT. My research interests are generally computer architecture, especifically GPUs, parallel computing systems, heterogeneous systems and energy-efficient designs. Also, I am excitingly willing to work on hardware accelerators, especially for emerging applications (generally data-intensive applications like machine learning).
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge and experience on deep learning and computer architecure. 
- 👯 I’m looking for collaboration on open-source processors simulators and teaching projects.
