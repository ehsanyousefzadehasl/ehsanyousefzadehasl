### Greetings
I hold a master's degree in Computer Architecture from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. My primary field of interest is Computer Architecture, particularly GPUs, parallel computing systems, and energy-efficient designs and their application in heterogeneous systems. Additionally, I am enthusiastically willing to work and research on hardware accelerators, especially for ML and NN applications or using these concepts.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Computer Architecture, focusing on Processing In-Memory (PIM), Memory Consistency Models and Cache Cohernece Protocols.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about computer architecture, PIM, deep learning, and other computer science concepts to fill my knowledge gaps.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on simulators for processors. The goal is learning through doing.
